# MEE PORTAL Selenium Framework

### Prepare your machine:
JDK Install (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
and let it install to the default directory

IDE Install of your choice (IntelliJ Idea/Eclipse)

## OSX:

In Mac OSX 10.5 or later, Apple recommends to set the $JAVA_HOME variable to 
/usr/libexec/java_home in file ~/. bash_profile or ~/.profile.

##### Set JAVA_HOME

Open a new Terminal: 
**cd ~** 
**vim .bash_profile** 
(This creates a new .bash_profile file using text editor VIM in your root directory)

Press **I** to Insert a new line and add:
**export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)**

To exit and Save VIM press **ESC**, then **:** and type **wq** and **Return** to save your changes

In Terminal use:
**source .bash_profile**
so your machine recognises the changes

Now enter
**echo $JAVA_HOME**
and a path to your Java installation should be shown correctly eg: 
*/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.7.0.jdk/Contents/Home*

#### MAVEN installation 

The easiest way to install Maven correctly is to use Homebrew.
Open a Terminal and paste this command to install Homebrew:
**/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"**

Install Maven with these two commands in Terminal:
**brew doctor**
**brew install maven**

To ensure Maven has been installed correctly 
**mvn -v** 
and you should see something similar to this output:

*Apache Maven 3.3.9 (bb52d8502b132ec0a5a3f4c09453c07478323dc5; 2015-11-10T16:41:47+00:00)
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.3.9/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_73, vendor: Oracle Corporation
Java home: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_73.jdk/Contents/Home/jre
Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8
OS name: "mac os x", version: "10.11.3", arch: "x86_64", family: "mac"*

#### Set-up the Framework

In Stash navigate to the **MEE Portal Automation** repo and Clone
https://stash.macmillan.education/projects/QTT/repos/mee_portal_automation

Example:
Open a Terminal: 
**git clone https://User.Name@stash.macmillan.education/scm/qtt/mee_admin_portal_automation.git** 

Next Clone this Repo which contains all of the required Selenium Servers and Drivers
**https://stash.macmillan.education/projects/QTT/repos/selenium-server-and-drivers/browse**


#### Start the Selenium Hub and Node
In Terminal navigate to the project folder i.e:
/Users/username/Documents/Repos/MacMillan/selenium_cucumber_framework

Make sure you now download the latest Selenium Standalone Server into the above project folder
http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

Start the node in Terminal with:
**java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role hub**

Start the hub in a new Terminal window with:
**java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.53.0.jar -role node -nodeConfig macNodeConfig.json**

The output should inform you that the node is registered and ready to use
*INFO - Registering the node to the hub: http://localhost:4444/grid/register*
*INFO - The node is registered to the hub and ready to use*

See the hub in the browser here:
http://localhost:4444/grid/console?config=true&configDebug=true#

#### Run the Tests locally

Open the Selenium_Cucumber_Framework project in the IDE of your choice and open the folder **testRunner** and the file **TestRunner**

Right click on the file and choose Run TestRunner and a Chrome browser should open and run through the SampleGoogleSearch.feature file tests
 
Open **config.properties** to make changes to the local browser, its default setting should be **browser:Chrome**


## PC:

#### Set JAVA_HOME

Locate where the JDK software is installed on your PC and copy the path i.e.
C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0_02

To set JAVA_HOME right click on My Computer, Properties, Advanced Tab and select Enviornment Variables
now edit or Add JAVA_HOME and past the path copied from the step above

#### MAVEN installation 
Visit Maven official website, download the Maven zip file, for example:
apache-maven-3.2.2-bin.zip. Unzip it to the folder you want to install Maven.

Assume you unzip to this folder
C:\Program Files\Apache\maven

Add the above paths to both **M2_HOME** and **MAVEN_HOME** variables in the Windows **Environment Variables**

To ensure Maven has been installed correctly 
**mvn -v** 
and you should see something similar to this output:

*C:\Users\mkyong>mvn -version
Apache Maven 3.2.2 (45f7c06d68e745d05611f7fd14efb6594181933e; 2014-06-17T21:51:42+08:00)
